# Private Events

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events

So I've mostly been sailing through the Rails section of TOP and this one was my first real road block that made me go huh. In my mind I can visual many-to-many relationship but once I get to coding they start falling apart a little bit. With a little effort though I got this one going. I feel like the part I struggled with was not so much the ActiveRecord but with the has_many, through, and etc but I feel like there is a link missing between that and the migrations themseleves. I found myself making the migration and setting the attendee_id myself and then it started working. Maybe I need more research, but at least I got it working.

On to the next!!
